# Challenging Inaccessibility

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

As I worked though this project, I found myself motivated by my own desire to understand how to make webpages more accesible to users.

I built this project because I am aware that accessibility is something that is becoming more and more readily available now in all different kinds of media. It's important to me to learn how to be considerate towards different needs especially when I, myself, believe that content creators should be held responsible for accommodating their audiences, clients, users, etc.

The issue that this project solves is the lack of accounting for audiences who benefit from accessibilty.

I learned how to use the alt attribute for accessibility purposes and I was able to apply what I have learned about responsive design to my code. I realized how nice it is to provide comments on my CSS and how it allows for me to organize my thoughts and actions. I also learned through trial and error how to rename my local repository and sync it to a renamed GitHub repository.

## Usage

Within this application, each image has an alt attribute and provides alternative text descriptions for the user's convenience. These alt tags can be viewed if the user is using a screenreader or if the user views the accessibility feature of the inspect element tools.

The deployed application should look something like this:
